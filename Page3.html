		<p>Primary school education in the Philippines spans 6 years in duration and is compulsory for all students.  This level of education is divided into a four-year primary cycle and a two-year intermediate cycle.  In the country’s public schools, Filipino children generally begin school at age 6 or 7; however, private schools typically start a year earlier and operate a seven-year curriculum rather than a six-year curriculum.</p><br><br>

		<p>Although secondary education is not compulsory in the Philippines, it is widely attended, particularly in the more urban areas of the country.  At this level, private schools enroll a much higher percentage of students than at the elementary level. According to statistics from the Department of Education, roughly 45 percent of the country’s high schools are private, enrolling about 21 percent of all secondary school students.</p><br><br>

		<p>Higher education institutions can apply for volunteer accreditation through CHED—a system modeled after the regional accreditation system used in the United States.  There are four levels of accreditation:

Level I.  Gives applicant status to schools that have undergone a preliminary survey and are capable of acquiring accredited status within two years.
Level II.  Gives full administrative deregulation and partial curricular autonomy, including priority in funding assistance and subsidies for faculty development.
Level III. Schools are granted full curricular deregulation, including the privilege to offer distance education programs.
Level IV. Universities are eligible for grants and subsidies from the Higher Education Development Fund and are granted full autonomy from government supervision and control.</p>
