				Education in the Philippines:  Structure
			</h4>
			<p>Education in the Philippines is offered through formal and non-formal systems.  Formal education typically spans 14 years and is structured in a 6+4+4 system:  6 years of primary school education, 4 years of secondary school education, and 4 years of higher education, leading to a bachelor’s degree.  This is one of the shortest terms of formal education in the world.</p><br>

            <p>In the Philippines, the academic school year begins in June and concludes in March, a period that covers a total of 40 weeks.  All higher education institutions operate on a semester system—fall semester, winter semester and an optional summer term.  Schooling is compulsory for 6 years, beginning at age 7 and culminating at age 12.  These 6 years represent a child’s primary school education.</p><br>

            <p>Although English was the sole language of instruction in the Philippines form 1935 to 1987, the new constitution prescribed that both Pilipino (Tagalog) and English are the official language of instruction and communication.  After primary school, however, the language of instruction is almost always English, especially in the country’s urban areas and at most of the nation’s universities.</p>
