				<p>The education system of the Philippines has been highly influenced by the country’s colonial history.  That history has included periods of Spanish, American and Japanese rule and occupation.  The most important and lasting contributions came during America’s occupation of the country, which began in 1898.  It was during that period that English was introduced as the primary language of instruction and a system of public education was first established—a system modeled after the United States school system and administered by the newly established Department of Instruction.</p><br>
<p>The United States left a lasting impression on the Philippine school system.  Several colleges and universities were founded with the goal of educating the nation’s teachers.  In 1908, the University of the Philippines was chartered, representing the first comprehensive public university in the nation’s history.</p><br>

<p>Like the United States, the Philippine nation has an extensive and highly inclusive system of education, including higher education.  In the present day, the United States continues to influence the Philippines education system, as many of the country’s teachers and professors have earned advanced degrees from United States universities.</p><br>
